Hi!

I'm studying to become a .NET Web Developer at EC Utbildning and this is my third school assignment. This assignment was done during the C# course and the main focus of the assignment was to build a console application. I also created a WPF application with extended functionality.

Some topics covered in this assignment:
- C#
- SOLID principles
- Interfaces
- Service- and Repository-pattern
- Factories, helpers, Validators
- Serialize and deserialize Json
- WPF-application
- MVVM - Model-View-ViewModel
- WPF navigation using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
- Unit tests (xUnit) with NSubstitute.
